      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are lots of reasons why I have not built a personal webiste - the whole desgner problem of never being able to finalize a design, the lack of need, and my serial interest in trying new tools and learning them to a point but not putting that knowledge into practice. It will remain to be seen if this time is any different but I have a good feeling it is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
