      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have this eternal struggle with analog vs digital. I love trying out new products and have bounced from one tool to the next when it comes to life organization and note taking. Add in the complexity of collaboration and syncing up which tools to use with which person and it can be a real problem. On the flip side I have been using &lt;a href=&#34;https://fieldnotesbrand.com/&#34;&gt;Field Notes&lt;/a&gt; bookelts for as long as I can remember and recently I have been crushing on a number of Japaneese stationary products. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I will ever go fully analog or fully digital but therein lies the problem of how to keep things organized and what systems to put in place to keep the two methods talking to oneanother.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
